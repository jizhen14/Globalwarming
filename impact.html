<h2>What is the impact of global warming?</h2>
Global warming is already having significant and costly effects on our communities, our health, and our climate.
Unless we take immediate action to reduce global warming emissions, these impacts will continue to intensify, grow ever more costly and damaging, and increasingly affect the entire planet — including you, your community, and your family.
